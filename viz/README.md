## Getting data used for visualizations

We have aggregated the logs generated by each training and/or additional visualization script in `simmim/` and `deit/` folders. Please download [all_logs.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTSxNFoNs6hf3Rw13E2myEdD0eFuEU_7/view?usp=sharing) and extract it.

## Generating visualizations

Simply run `python <script.py> --data <log dir>` to run a given visualization script. The `<log dir>` is the extracted directory of the `all_logs.zip` file above.
