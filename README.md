# Accelerating Vision Transformer Training via a Patch Sampling Schedule (PSS)

This codebase shows how to train and validate models trained with a Patch Sampling Scheduele (PSS).

## Training and Inference results
Please refer to the `simmim/` or `deit/` directories for more information on how to train and validate these models using a PSS.

The `data/` directory provides a snapshot of the results for both ViT-B and DeiT models.
